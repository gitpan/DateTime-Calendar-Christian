Revision history for Perl extension DateTime::Calendar::Christian.

0.03  2003-04-24
    - added nanosecond support, by requiring DateTime 0.10

    - a change in DateTime caused a failure of a test script (t/08math.t
      again); fortunately it was in a TODO block; replaced that by
      todo_skip

0.02  2003-03-27
    - how embarrassing - there's a bug in t/08math.t ... now fixed, of
      course

    - added a number of calendar reform dates; there are now 41 of them
      included

0.01  2003-03-26
	- original version (still buggy, probably)
